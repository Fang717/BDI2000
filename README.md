# BDI2000 Reverse Engineering Project
This repository is dedicated to the reverse engineering of the Abatron BDI2000 JTAG debugger—an essential tool once widely used for embedded development and debugging across PowerPC, ARM, and MIPS platforms.

With Abatron’s BDI series now officially discontinued (End of Life announced on **March 9, 2015**), this project aims to preserve technical knowledge and provide insights into the inner workings of the **BDI2000** hardware and firmware.

Planned content includes:

- Hardware schematics and analysis

- Firmware behavior and structure

- Interface protocols and pinouts

- Boot process documentation

- Recovered data and diagnostics

Notes on potential open-source replacements or emulation

This work is for educational and archival purposes, supporting the embedded systems community in maintaining and understanding legacy development tools.
